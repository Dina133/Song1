How can you see into my eyes
Like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb
Without a soul (soul)
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) wake me up inside
(Save me) call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) before I come undone
(Save me) save me from the nothing I've become
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me (oh, oh-oh)
Breathe into me and make me real (make me real)
Bring (bring) me (me) to life
wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) wake me up inside
(Save me) call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) before I come undone
(Save me) save me from the nothing I've become
